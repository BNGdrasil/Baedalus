## Overview

**Baedalus** is the Infrastructure as Code (IaC) foundation of the [BNGdrasil](https://github.com/BNGdrasil/BNGdrasil) cloud infrastructure project. Named after the master craftsman from Greek mythology, Baedalus provisions and manages cloud infrastructure across multiple cloud service providers (CSP) and prepares for eventual transition to OpenStack-based home lab environments.

### Key Features

- **Multi-Cloud Ready**: Designed for Oracle Cloud with AWS/Azure expansion planned
- **Declarative Infrastructure**: Terraform-based infrastructure management
- **Automated Deployment**: Complete CI/CD pipeline integration
- **Security Focused**: Network isolation with public/private subnet architecture
- **Scalable Design**: From single VM to multi-tier application architecture
- **Container Ready**: Docker and Docker Compose pre-configured
- **Cost Optimized**: ARM-based instances with efficient resource allocation

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Terraform >= 1.0
- Oracle Cloud Infrastructure account
- OCI CLI configured or API key setup
- SSH key pair for instance access

### Installation

#### Using Makefile (Recommended)

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/BNGdrasil/Baedalus.git
cd Baedalus

# Setup environment
make setup

# Initialize and deploy infrastructure
make init
make plan
make apply
```

#### Manual Setup

```bash
# Copy and configure environment variables
cp terraform.tfvars.example terraform.tfvars
# Edit terraform.tfvars with your OCI credentials

# Initialize and deploy
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply
```

### Access Points

Once deployed, you can access:

- **Instance SSH**: `ssh ubuntu@<public_ip>`
- **Application Services**: `http://<public_ip>:8000` (when applications are deployed)
- **Infrastructure Status**: `terraform show`

### Application Deployment

```bash
# Deploy applications to the provisioned infrastructure
make deploy SERVER_IP=<server_ip>

# Or use the deployment script directly
./scripts/deploy.sh <server_ip> [ssh_user]
```

---

## Infrastructure Configuration

### Core Components

- **VCN & Networking** (`main.tf`): Virtual Cloud Network with public/private subnet architecture
- **Compute Resources** (`main.tf`): ARM-based Ubuntu instances with auto-scaling capabilities
- **Security Configuration** (`main.tf`): Security lists, network ACLs, and access controls
- **Automation Scripts** (`scripts/`): Deployment and initialization automation
- **Variable Management** (`variables.tf`): Centralized configuration management

### Project Structure

| Output | Description | Example |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| `public_ip` | Reserved public IP address of the main instance | `129.159.XXX.XXX` |
| `instance_id` | Oracle Cloud Infrastructure instance OCID | `ocid1.instance.oc1.iad.xxx` |

### Terraform State Management

```bash
# View current state
terraform show

# List all resources
terraform state list

# Get specific output
terraform output public_ip
```

### Resource Inspection

terraform state show oci_core_instance.bnbong_server

# Validate configuration
terraform validate

# Plan changes
terraform plan
```

## Security

### Security Features

- **Network Isolation**: VCN with controlled subnet access
- **SSH Key Authentication**: Public key authentication only
- **Security Lists**: Configurable port-based access control
- **Reserved IP**: Static IP assignment for consistent access
- **Secret Management**: Environment-based credential storage
- **Audit Logging**: OCI native logging and monitoring

### Security Best Practices

1. **Never commit secrets** to version control
2. **Use environment variables** for OCI credentials
3. **Enable MFA** for OCI console access
4. **Configure security lists** restrictively for production
5. **Monitor infrastructure changes** regularly
6. **Keep Terraform state** secure and encrypted
